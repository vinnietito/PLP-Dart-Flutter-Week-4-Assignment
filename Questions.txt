**String Manipulation: ** Implement a program that demonstrates string concatenation, interpolation, 
substring extraction, and case conversion (upper/lowercase). Add functionality to reverse a string and count its length.


Collections (Lists, Sets, Maps):
Create a Dart program that demonstrates the use of lists, sets, and maps. Include operations like adding, removing, 
and iterating over items. Showcase scenarios where each collection type is most appropriate.


File Handling:
Write a Dart program that reads content from a file and writes new data into another file. Demonstrate how to handle errors during file operations.


Date and Time:
Develop a program that uses Dart's DateTime class. Format, parse, and manipulate dates (e.g., add/subtract days). 
Calculate the difference between two dates.


Exercise:
Combine the above utilities to build a small application. This application should: Perform string manipulation on user input. 
Store the results in a collection. Save the data to a file. Use the date and time utilities to log when each entry was made.
